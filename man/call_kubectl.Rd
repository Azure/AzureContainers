\title{Call the Kubernetes commandline tool, kubectl}
\usage{
call_kubectl(cmd = "", config = NULL, ...,
  echo = getOption("azure_containers_tool_echo", TRUE))
}
\arguments{
\item{cmd}{The kubectl command line to execute. This should be a \emph{vector} of individual kubectl arguments, but can also be a single commandline string. See below.}

\item{config}{The pathname of the cluster config file, if required.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to pass to \link[processx:run]{processx::run}.}

\item{echo}{Whether to echo the output of the command to the console.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{status}: The exit status of the kubectl tool. If this is \code{NA}, then the process was killed and had no exit status.
\item \code{stdout}: The standard output of the command, in a character scalar.
\item \code{stderr}: The standard error of the command, in a character scalar.
\item \code{timeout}: Whether the process was killed because of a timeout.
\item \code{cmdline}: The command line.
}

The first four components are from \code{processx::run}; AzureContainers adds the last to make it easier to construct scripts that can be run outside R.

\description{
Call the Kubernetes commandline tool, kubectl
}
\details{
This function calls the \code{kubectl} binary, which must be located in your search path. AzureContainers will search for the binary at package startup, and print a warning if it is not found.

The kubectl command should be specified as a vector of the individual arguments, which is what \code{processx::run} expects. If a single string is passed, for convenience and back-compatibility reasons \code{call_docker_compose} will split it into arguments for you. This is prone to error, for example if you are working with pathnames that contain spaces, so it's strongly recommended to pass a vector of arguments as a general practice.

\dontrun{

# without any args, prints the kubectl help screen
call_kubectl()

# append "--help" to get help for a command
call_kubectl("create --help")

# deploy a service from a yaml file
call_kubectl("create -f deployment.yaml")

# get deployment and service status
call_kubectl("get deployment")
call_kubectl("get service")
